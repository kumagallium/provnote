Graphium is a personal open-source project that combines [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)-style atomic note-taking with [PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/), a W3C provenance standard. The result is a notebook where every claim, including the ones an AI hands you, can be traced back to the notes and sources that justify it.

- 📘 [**CONCEPT**](docs/CONCEPT.md) ([日本語](docs/CONCEPT.ja.md)) — the design philosophy: why provenance matters, the two brains, the hourglass.
- 🏗️ [**ARCHITECTURE**](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — layers, distribution targets, the Wiki pipeline, known seams.
- 🗂️ [**DATA_MODEL**](docs/DATA_MODEL.md) — the on-disk JSON shapes, schemas, and compatibility rules.

## Use as much, or as little, as you need

Graphium is designed around **progressive disclosure**. Labelling is optional, and it comes in two layers you can adopt independently.

| Level | What you do | What you get |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Just notes** | Write and link notes with `@` references | A linked notebook on your filesystem (or browser IndexedDB on the web) |
| **Block-level structure** | Mark heading blocks as `[Step]` (or as a phase: `[Plan]` / `[Result]`) | The skeleton of a provenance graph — what happened, in what order |
| **Inline detail** | Highlight spans inside a block as `[Input]` / `[Tool]` / `[Parameter]` / `[Output]` | A full provenance graph — what was used, with what conditions, what came out |

The `#` block labels and the inline highlights are two passes over the same content, not a single all-or-nothing label. You can write a note with no labels, give it a step structure later, and add inline detail only on the parts that matter. **The provenance layer activates only where you choose** — that gradient *is* the design.

For the deeper rationale, see [docs/CONCEPT.md §6](docs/CONCEPT.md#6-progressive-disclosure-use-as-much-or-as-little-as-you-need).

## Try it now

**[→ Preview in your browser (GitHub Pages)](https://kumagallium.github.io/Graphium/)**

The browser version is a **preview** to try the editor and PROV-DM labeling. Notes are stored in this browser's IndexedDB — fine for kicking the tires, but the desktop app or self-hosted Docker is what you want for the full experience: AI features (Knowledge Layer, AI chat), durable storage, and cross-device sync.

### Desktop app

Download the desktop app to save notes as plain JSON files on your filesystem. Point the save folder at a Google Drive / iCloud / Dropbox synced folder if you want cloud sync — no extra OAuth setup needed.

| Platform | File | How to check |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon — M1/M2/M3/M4) | `Graphium_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg` | Apple menu →  About This Mac → "Apple M..." |

**[→ Download from Releases](https://github.com/kumagallium/Graphium/releases/latest)**

> **Other platforms**
> The desktop build currently ships only for macOS Apple Silicon. If you are on Windows, Linux, or Intel macOS, please use the [browser version on GitHub Pages](https://kumagallium.github.io/Graphium/) (no install) or self-host with the [Docker setup](#option-2-run-with-docker--editor-only) described below. Bringing the desktop app back to other platforms is on the roadmap; see [issues](https://github.com/kumagallium/Graphium/issues) if you'd like to help test.

### Mobile (paused)

A mobile capture flow (PWA, quick memos, camera capture) was prototyped but is currently **paused** while the desktop and Knowledge Layer work matures. The browser version still installs on iOS / Android home screens, but mobile-specific features (timeline view, quick capture button) are not actively maintained at the moment.

If you want to follow or help restart this work, see the [issues](https://github.com/kumagallium/Graphium/issues).

## AI Knowledge Layer

When you connect an LLM, Graphium builds a **second layer** on top of your notes — an editable AI Wiki auto-generated from what you've written. Think of it as *Zettelkasten extended by an LLM*: the AI reads your notes, extracts stable ideas, keeps them cross-linked, and cites back to the source blocks — all while carrying the same PROV-DM provenance as the rest of the editor.

The Wiki has four document kinds, each with a distinct role:

| Kind | Role |
|------|------|
| **Summary** | Internal-facing summary of one note. |
| **Concept** | Cross-note synthesis with key elements extracted. Concepts qualify by `level` (principle / finding / bridge) and `status` (candidate / verified). |
| **Atom** | Experimental layer. One context-free claim with citations back to the source notes — the unit that travels across projects. |
| **Synthesis** | Experimental layer. New insight built by weaving Atoms together. |

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Five-stage pipeline** | Ingest → Atomize → Synthesize → Cross-update → Lint, all running on the companion server. Triggered when you save a note. |
| **Ingest from notes** | The AI extracts knowledge-worthy sections and writes them into Wiki pages, citing back to source blocks. |
| **Ingest from URL & chat** | Drop a URL or save an AI chat response — it becomes a Wiki page with the same provenance chain. |
| **Cross-update** | When one Wiki page changes, dependent pages are flagged or rewritten so the layer stays consistent. |
| **Lint** | Detects orphan Atoms, broken citations, and redundant Concepts. |
| **Edit protection** | Sections you manually edited are skipped during re-ingest, so your corrections survive. |
| **Retriever for AI chat** | Wiki context is injected into AI responses — the assistant remembers what you wrote last week without re-reading every note. |
| **Auto-labeled answers** | AI replies are inserted with PROV-DM structure already attached: `[Step]` labels on activity headings, inline highlights for `[Input]` / `[Tool]` / `[Parameter]` / `[Output]`, and `informed_by` links between consecutive steps. A provenance graph emerges from the chat itself, no manual labeling required. |

Wiki pages live in the same storage as your notes (IndexedDB on web, filesystem on Tauri / Docker) and are fully editable by hand. Every Wiki edit is recorded as a PROV-DM revision so you can always see **when** a page was generated, **which agent** (human or AI) wrote it, and **from which source**.

AI Knowledge is **opt-in**: configure an LLM in **⚙ Settings → AI Setup** to activate it. Without an LLM, Graphium works as a plain linked-note editor.

## Composer (⌘K)

A single palette for finding what you've written and asking what's next. Hit `⌘K` (or `Ctrl+K`) anywhere in Graphium and start typing.

| Input | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Words from a title or heading | Jump straight to that note (Wiki entries are surfaced too) |
| `#label` | Filter by context label — `#procedure`, `#step`, `#手順` all map to the same thing |
| `@author` | Filter by who wrote it — humans by username, AI by model name |
| Empty | Recent notes plus *discovery cards* — quick prompts derived from your active note and the last week of Wiki activity (ingest / cross-update / regenerate / merge) |
| `Cmd+Enter` | Send the input to the AI assistant instead of jumping |

The Composer is the entry point that ties the editor, the AI Knowledge Layer, and your own past work into one motion.

## Templates

The `/template` slash command opens a picker with reusable scaffolds:

- **Plan template** — H1 title, Background / Goals, a reference table (Item × Conditions), and Expected Outcomes. Each row of the table becomes a child note when you derive it.
- **Run template** — a per-item record where blocks are pre-labeled (`[Step]` for activities; inline `[Input]` / `[Tool]` / `[Parameter]` / `[Output]` for entities) and consecutive steps are pre-linked with `informed_by`. Use it as a working example of "what a fully labeled note looks like."

The vocabulary is generic: it fits lab experiments, cooking, manufacturing runs, or any project workflow. User-defined templates can be registered programmatically (`registerUserTemplate()`).

## Reading comfort

Some people read more comfortably with letterforms designed for dyslexia. Graphium ships with **[Atkinson Hyperlegible Next](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/)** and **[Lexend](https://www.lexend.com/)** as built-in choices alongside Inter, switchable from **⚙ Settings → General**. Pick what works for your eyes — the rest of the editor stays the same.

## Interoperability

Graphium exports provenance as **[PROV-JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/submissions/2024/SUBM-prov-jsonld-20240825/)** — a W3C standard built on Linked Data. This is not a proprietary format: any tool that understands PROV-DM or JSON-LD can consume Graphium's output. Provenance data is portable by design.

## How to use

### Option 1: Use online (no setup)

Visit **https://kumagallium.github.io/Graphium/** and start writing. Your notes are saved in your browser's IndexedDB.

> **Want the same notes on multiple machines?** Use the [desktop app](#desktop-app) and point its save folder at a Google Drive / iCloud / Dropbox synced folder.

### Option 2: Run with Docker — editor only

Run Graphium as a standalone editor — no AI, no external services. Just the note editor.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumagallium/Graphium.git
cd Graphium
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:5174/Graphium/** and start writing.

### Option 3: Run with Docker — full stack (AI + MCP tools)

Run Graphium with the built-in AI backend and [Crucible Registry](https://github.com/kumagallium/Crucible) for MCP tool management.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumagallium/Graphium.git
cd Graphium
docker compose up -d
```

| URL | What it is |
|-----|------------|
| http://localhost:5174/Graphium/ | Graphium editor (includes AI setup) |

> **Advanced:** [Crucible Registry UI](http://localhost:8081) is available for MCP server management.

#### Set up your AI model

1. Open **http://localhost:5174/Graphium/**
2. Go to **⚙ Settings → AI Setup**, add your LLM model and API key
3. Start using the AI assistant

#### Add MCP tools (optional)

1. Open **http://localhost:8081** (Crucible Registry UI)
2. Register an MCP server from a GitHub repository
3. Tools appear in **⚙ Settings → AI Setup** and can be toggled on/off

No `.env` editing required — everything is configured from the browser.

> **Self-hosting and storage**
> When running under Docker (or any self-hosted Node.js backend), notes are saved to the server filesystem at `/app/data` by default — visit the same URL from any browser or device and you see the same notes. The frontend auto-detects this on first load.
> - **Cloud backup**: mount a Google Drive / iCloud / Dropbox synced folder to `/app/data` (`volumes: - "~/Google Drive/Graphium:/app/data"`) and the OS handles replication.
> - **Remote VPS**: use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) or similar to back up `/app/data` to S3 / B2 / etc.
> - **Authentication**: set `GRAPHIUM_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-secret>` to require an `X-Graphium-Token` header on all storage requests. Configure the same token in **⚙ Settings → Server Storage** in the UI. Without this, anyone who can reach the URL can read/write notes — fine on `localhost`, not for public deployments.

> **Note:** In Docker mode, all services run without API key authentication and are only accessible from your local machine (`localhost`).

#### Updating to the latest version

```bash
./update.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
git pull                      # Get latest Graphium code
docker compose pull           # Pull latest Crucible images
docker compose up -d --build  # Rebuild Graphium and restart all services
```

### Option 4: Run for development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumagallium/Graphium.git
cd Graphium
pnpm install
pnpm dev --port 5174   # → http://localhost:5174/Graphium/
```

Notes are saved to your browser's IndexedDB by default. AI features require the backend server — run `pnpm dev` which starts both the frontend and backend together. Go to **⚙ Settings → AI Setup** to add your LLM model.

## Features

- **Block-level context labels** — `[Step]` (PROV *Activity*), plus `[Plan]` / `[Result]` for phases
- **Inline entity highlights** — highlight spans inside a block as `[Input]` / `[Tool]` / `[Parameter]` / `[Output]`. The first three become PROV-DM *Entity* nodes (with `material` / `tool` subtypes internally), and `[Parameter]` attaches as a *Property* on the parent. Identical referents share an `entityId` so they collapse into one node in the graph
- **Media inline labels** — image / video / audio / PDF blocks can carry the same `[Input]` / `[Tool]` / `[Parameter]` / `[Output]` labels via a side-store (BlockNote inline styles don't apply to media)
- **Block-to-block linking** with provenance semantics (`informed_by`, `derived_from`, `used`)
- **Multi-page tabbed editor** with scope derivation
- **Reference table** — manage related notes in a tabular view with side-peek preview
- **PROV-JSON-LD export** — W3C-compliant per-page provenance export
- **Provenance graph** visualization (Cytoscape.js + ELK layout)
- **Inter-note network graph** (Cytoscape.js + fcose layout)
- **AI assistant** — derive notes from AI responses with full provenance metadata
- **AI auto-labeling** — AI answers are inserted with PROV-DM context labels and `informed_by` chains already attached
- **AI Knowledge Layer** — editable AI Wiki with four document kinds (*Summary* / *Concept* / *Atom* / *Synthesis*), a five-stage pipeline (ingest → atomize → synthesize → cross-update → lint), and edit protection on re-ingest
- **Composer (⌘K)** — unified palette for note search (`#label` / `@author` filters), discovery cards, and AI ask
- **Skills** — reusable prompt templates stored as Graphium documents (`source: "skill"`); apply during ingest or chat
- **Sharing & Library** — share a note to a content-addressed shared store; others can browse the Library and Fork. Embedded media is materialized as `shared-blob:` references on share
- **Templates** — `/template` slash command with Plan and Run scaffolds (extensible)
- **Reading-font setting** — pick between Inter (default), Atkinson Hyperlegible Next, and Lexend; opt-in for dyslexia-aware reading
- **Local-first storage** — plain JSON files on your filesystem (desktop / Docker) or IndexedDB (browser)
- **Desktop app** — Tauri v2 native app with local file storage; point the save folder at a synced cloud folder (Drive / iCloud / Dropbox) for cross-device sync without OAuth

## PROV-DM compliance

Graphium implements a **two-layer provenance model**, both conforming to the [W3C PROV Data Model (PROV-DM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/).

### Layer 1: World provenance — what the note is about

Labels attach to content in two independent passes that compose into one PROV-DM graph:

#### Block-level — the skeleton

A heading block can be tagged via the `#` menu:

| UI label | Internal key | PROV-DM type | Description |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| `[Step]` | `procedure` | `prov:Activity` | A step in a process. H2 boundaries also create implicit Activities via the heading `scopeStack`. |
| `[Plan]` | `plan` | grouping | Phase: planning portion of a process. |
| `[Result]` | `result` | grouping | Phase: result portion of a process. |

#### Inline highlights — the detail

Spans inside a block can be highlighted as one of:

| UI label | Internal key | PROV-DM mapping |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| `[Input]` | `material` | `prov:Entity` with `material` subtype (substance / input transformed in a process) |
| `[Tool]` | `tool` | `prov:Entity` with `tool` subtype (equipment / instrument) |
| `[Parameter]` | `attribute` | A *Property* attached to the parent Activity or Entity (condition / setting) |
| `[Output]` | `output` | `prov:Entity` (artifact the activity generated) |

Highlights inside the same block can carry the same `entityId`, in which case they collapse to one PROV Entity node — the deduplication key for repeated references to the same referent. Image / video / audio / PDF blocks carry the same labels via a `mediaInlineLabels` side-store, since BlockNote inline styles don't apply to media.

Relationships emitted: `prov:used` (Usage), `prov:wasGeneratedBy` (Generation), `prov:wasInformedBy` (via prior-step links).

The two passes are independent. A note can have only block-level labels, only inline highlights, both, or neither — and you only get the parts of the graph you've labeled.

### Layer 2: Document Provenance — edit history

Every save creates a revision chain tracked as PROV-DM:

| Concept | PROV-DM mapping |
|---------|----------------|
| Editor (human or AI) | `prov:Agent` |
| Edit operation | `prov:Activity` with `startTime` / `endTime` |
| Document revision | `prov:Entity` with `prov:generatedAtTime` |
| Editor → edit | `prov:Association` |
| Edit → revision | `prov:Generation` |
| Revision → previous | `prov:Derivation` |

Document provenance is exported as a `prov:Bundle`, separate from content provenance.

### PROV-JSON-LD export

The per-page export conforms to the [W3C PROV-JSON-LD specification](https://www.w3.org/submissions/2024/SUBM-prov-jsonld-20240825/):

- Uses the [openprovenance context](https://openprovenance.org/prov-jsonld/context.jsonld)
- Unprefixed `@type` values (`Entity`, `Activity`, `Agent`)
- Relationships as separate objects (`Usage`, `Generation`, `Derivation`, `Association`)
- Standard property names (`startTime`, `endTime`, `entity`, `activity`, `agent`)

Graphium-specific extensions use the `graphium:` namespace (`https://graphium.app/ns#`), including `graphium:entityType`, `graphium:attributes`, `graphium:editType`, `graphium:summary`, and `graphium:contentHash`.

## Architecture (at a glance)

Graphium is a TypeScript / React app on top of [BlockNote.js](https://www.blocknotejs.org/), shipped three ways: as a web PWA (notes in IndexedDB), as a [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app/) desktop app (notes as JSON files on the filesystem), and as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) self-host with a Node.js companion server. The companion server is built on [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and runs the AI Knowledge Layer pipeline (ingest → atomize → synthesize → cross-update → lint).

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Editor | TypeScript / React / BlockNote.js |
| AI runtime | Vercel AI SDK |
| Companion server | Node.js / Hono |
| Storage | IndexedDB (web) / filesystem (Tauri / Docker) |
| Desktop | Tauri v2 (currently macOS Apple Silicon only; see roadmap) |
| Graph visualization | Cytoscape.js |
| Build / pkg manager | Vite / pnpm |

For the layered breakdown, the Wiki pipeline trigger flow, distribution targets, the auth model, and known seams, read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). For on-disk JSON shapes and compatibility rules, read [docs/DATA_MODEL.md](docs/DATA_MODEL.md).

### Crucible Registry (optional)

[Crucible Registry](https://github.com/kumagallium/Crucible) provides MCP server management with auto-discovery. When connected, registered MCP tools appear in **⚙ Settings → AI Setup** and can be used by the AI assistant.

## Beyond the editor

Graphium notes don't have to be written inside Graphium. The bundled [`save-to-graphium`](scripts/claude-code-skill/save-to-graphium/SKILL.md) skill lets [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (CLI or VS Code extension) save the gist of any conversation as a Graphium note. The note carries `agent: "claude-code"`, the model name, and the OS user as PROV-DM agent metadata, so AI-driven discussions get the same provenance trail as anything you wrote by hand.

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/scripts/claude-code-skill/save-to-graphium" ~/.claude/skills/save-to-graphium
```

After the symlink is in place, just ask Claude Code "save this to Graphium" — the note appears in your sidebar on next launch, ready to be linked, labeled, or pushed into the Knowledge Layer.

## Language & Internationalization

Graphium supports **English** (default) and **Japanese**. The language can be switched from **⚙ Settings** in the sidebar.

All user-facing text — context labels, menus, tooltips, and panel UI — is fully internationalized. Context labels are displayed in the active locale (e.g. `[Step]` in English, `[ステップ]` in Japanese) while the internal data format remains stable for backward compatibility.

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Context labels | Fully localized (English / Japanese) |
| UI chrome | Fully localized |
| Label input | Both languages accepted as aliases (e.g. `[step]`, `[材料]`) |
| README / docs | English / Japanese |

Contributions for additional languages are welcome.
